## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The application follows a pure static website architecture built exclusively with HTML5 and CSS3, avoiding any JavaScript dependencies. This approach ensures fast loading times, excellent SEO performance, and broad compatibility across all devices and browsers.

**Layout System**: The site uses a flexible layout system with a toggleable sidebar navigation and main content area. The layout is controlled through CSS Grid and Flexbox, providing responsive behavior across different screen sizes.

**Component-Based Structure**: Each page follows a consistent template structure with reusable components including sidebar navigation, header sections, and content areas. The sidebar uses a CSS-only toggle mechanism implemented with checkbox inputs and CSS selectors.

**Responsive Design**: The architecture implements a mobile-first responsive design using CSS media queries, CSS custom properties (variables), and flexible layouts that adapt seamlessly from mobile to desktop viewports.

### Content Organization
**Topic-Based Structure**: Content is organized hierarchically with separate folders for each programming language (/html/, /css/, /javascript/). Each topic has its own dedicated HTML file with comprehensive educational content.

**Navigation System**: The sidebar navigation uses a CSS-only implementation that highlights the currently active topic. Navigation state is managed through CSS classes and pseudo-selectors without requiring JavaScript.

**Typography and Visual Hierarchy**: The design system uses custom CSS properties for consistent theming, including color schemes, typography scales, spacing systems, and visual effects like gradients and shadows.

### Styling Architecture
**CSS Custom Properties**: Extensive use of CSS variables for theming, including color palettes, gradients, spacing scales, typography systems, and component dimensions. This creates a maintainable design system that can be easily customized.

**Component Styling**: Modular CSS approach with styles organized by component functionality. Uses CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout, CSS transitions for interactions, and responsive design patterns.

**Visual Effects**: Implementation of modern CSS features including gradients, box shadows, border radius, and smooth transitions to create an engaging visual experience without requiring JavaScript.
